In this collaborative project, we explored trends between CBS show *Survivor* contestants with corresponding interactive visualizations. After utilizing a dataset sourced by David Oehm, we wanted to understnad what it takes for a contestant to win the entire game show. We each explored a different aspect of the dataset, and then compiled into a final presentation complete with analyses and Python models. I examined the distribution of MBTI personalities amongst the winners of the show, discovering that there was a positive correlation between certain personality types and the winning contestants.
